# Swarm-SLAM: Sparse Decentralized Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Framework for Multi-Robot Systems

![Swarm-SLAM Overview](media/system-overview.svg)

Swarm-SLAM is an open-source C-SLAM system that is designed to be scalable, flexible, decentralized, and sparse, which are all key properties in swarm robotics. Our system supports lidar, stereo, and RGB-D sensing, and it includes a novel inter-robot loop closure prioritization technique that reduces inter-robot communication and accelerates the convergence.
